## Installing Dependencies

After installing [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [NPM](https://npmjs.org/), run `npm install` from the project root to install the necessary NPM package dependencies.


## Starting Server

To start the servers, run the following commands from the project's root:

	node server.js
	node proxy.js

By default (set by `config.js`), the proxy will be listening on port `9000`.
